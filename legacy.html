    <section id="home"><h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Welcome! This is a site that I built <strong>for showcasing my projects I did in the past</strong>. This was
            built with backwards compatibility in mind that can support old browsers like Google Chrome on Windows XP.
            You would need an HTTP server (not secure) to run this on older browsers that don't support current standards.
            This site was also built for accessibility. It is made using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This website
            is being hosted on GitHub Pages. You can view the source code
            <a href="https://github.com/AwesomeKid99999/awesomekid99999.github.io">here</a>. Feel free to look around!
            <em>Pictures below this text are showing that the site is being attempted to run on old hardware, which is not
                the main focus. You can change accessibility settings in the top bar.</em></p>
